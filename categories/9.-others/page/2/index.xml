      <description>10. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA Introduction : Working directly with high-dimensional data comes with some difficulties It is hard to analyze, interpretation is difficult, visualization is nearly impossible, and storage of the data vectors can be expensive In this chapter, we derive PCA from first principles, drawing on our understanding of basis and basis change (Sections 2.6.1 and 2.7.2), projections (Section 3.8), eigenvalues (Section 4.2), Gaussian distributions (Section 6.5), and constrained optimization (Section 7.</description>

      <description>Introduction Kubernetes (k8s) : is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
Simply a container orchestration tool like docker swarm Kubernetes Components:
Kubernetes Cluster : set of worker machines (nodes)
Nodes : host the Pods that are the components of the application workload
Pod : the smallest deployable units
Contents
Pod
Service
kubectl
1. Pod Pods : are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.</description>

      <title>Effective Python #5 | Classes and Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://koreanbear89.github.io/language/1.-python/effective-python-05/</link>

      <description>Introduction As an oop language, Python supports a full range of features, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
Python’s classes and inheritance make it easy to express a program’s intended behaviors with objects.
They allow you to improve and expand functionality over time.
They provide flexibility in an environment of changing requirements.
Item 37. Compose Classes Instead of Nesting Many Levels of Build-in Types Avoid making dictionaries with values that are dictionaries, long tuples, or complex nestings of other build-in types.</description>

      <title>Effective Python #4 | Comprehensions and Generators</title>
      <link>https://koreanbear89.github.io/language/1.-python/effective-python-04/</link>

      <guid>https://koreanbear89.github.io/language/1.-python/effective-python-04/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Python provides a special syntax, called comprehensions, for succinctly iterating through these types (list, dict, set) and creating derivative data structures
This style of processing is extended to functions with generators, which enable a stream of values to be incrementally returned by a function.
Item 27. Use Comprehensions Instead of map and filter Comprehensions support multiple levels of loops and multiple conditions per loop level.
Comprehensions with more than two control subexpressions are very difficult to read and should be avoided.</description>

      <title>Effective Python #3 | Functions</title>
      <link>https://koreanbear89.github.io/language/1.-python/effective-python-03/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://koreanbear89.github.io/language/1.-python/effective-python-03/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Functions in Python have a variety of extra features that make a programmer’s life easier.
Some are similar to capabilities in other programming languages, but many are unique to Python. These extras can make a function’s purpose more obvious.
They can eliminate noise and clarify the intention of callers.
They can significantly reduce subtle bugs that are difficult to find.
Item 19. Never Unpack More Than Three Variables When Functions Return Multiple Values You can have functions return multiple values by putting them in a tuple and having the caller take advantage of Python’s unpacking syntax.</description>

      <title>Effective Python #2 | Lists and Dictionaries</title>

      <guid>https://koreanbear89.github.io/language/1.-python/effective-python-02/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In Python, the most common way to automate repetitive tasks is by using a sequence of values stored in a list type.
A natural complement to lists is the dict type, which stores lookup keys mapped to corresponding values (in what is often called an associative array or a hash table
Item 11. Know How to Slice Sequences Avoid being verbose when slicing: Don’t supply 0 for the start index or the length of the sequence for the end index.</description>

      <guid>https://koreanbear89.github.io/language/1.-python/effective-python-01/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The Pythonic style isn’t regimented or enforced by the compiler. It has emerged over time through experience using the language and working with others.
Python programmers prefer to be explicit, to choose simple over complex, and to maximize readability. Item 1. Know Which Version of Python You’re Using Throughout this book, the majority of example code is in the syntax of Python 3.7 (released in June 2018).
This book also provides some examples in the syntax of Python 3.</description>

Job : A piece of code that reads some input (HDFS or local), performs some computation and writes output.
Stages : Jobs are divided into stages. Stages are classified as a Map or reduce stages. Stages are divided based on computational boundaries, all computations cannot be Updated in a single Stage. It happens over many stages.
Tasks : Each stage has some tasks. One task is executed on one partition of data on one executor (machine).</description>
