      <description>1. Introduction and Motivation Machine learning is about designing algorithms that automatically extract valuable information from data. There are three concepts that are at the core of machine learning : data, a model, and learning. Data : Since machine learning is inherently data driven, data is at the core of machine learning. Model : would describe a function that maps inputs to real-valued outputs. Learning : can be understood as a way to automatically find patterns and structure in data by optimizing the parameters of the model 1.</description>

      <description>Summary Text Summarization : is a technique to shorten long texts such that the summary has all the important points of the actual document.
By Summarization Approache
Extraction-based Summarization: The extractive approach involves picking up the most important phrases and lines from the documents. It then combines all the important lines to create the summary. So, in this case, every line and word of the summary actually belongs to the original document which is summarized.</description>

      <description>9. Linear Regression In the following, we will apply the mathematical concepts from previous chapters, to solve linear regression (curve fitting) problems.
In regression, we aim to find a function $f$ that maps inputs $x∈R^D$ to corresponding function values $f(x)∈R.$
We are given a set of training inputs $x_n$ and corresponding noisy observations $y_n=f(x_n) + \epsilon$,
where $\epsilon$ is an i.i.d random variable that describes measurement and observation noise =&amp;gt; simply zero-mean Gaussian noise (not further in this chapter)</description>
